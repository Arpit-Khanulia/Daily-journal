# Daily-journal
The Daily Journal website is a platform designed for users to maintain a personal journal or diary.

The backend of the website is built using Node.js and Express.js. 

To ensure secure access and authentication, the website integrates Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. Users can create an account, log in, and securely access their journal entries. 

For data storage, the website employs MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and manage journal entries
